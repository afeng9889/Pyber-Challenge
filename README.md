#**Overview of the analysis:**

We gathered data from Pyber's first half of the year 2019 and organized the data to see which type of city environment garnered most of the ride and would have the highest average fares and highest fares per driver.
The ultimate goal is to help Pyber improve access to ride sharing services and determining affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

#**Results:**
There is a clear distinction between the city types and number of rides from each city type. The urban cities had more than double the amount of rides from both rural and suburban combined. However, this can be due tot he fact that there are much more available drivers in urban cities than the other two city types.
There is also a difference between the average fares per ride in each city type. The average fare for urban city is lower than suburban and rural.
Lastly, the average fares each driver would have charged per city is significantly higher in rural cities compared to urban and suburban counterparts.

#**Summary:**

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Pyber needs to address the disparities between the city types by increasing availability of the ride sharing service in the rural and suburban environments. 
In order to combat this, the CEO should increase incentives to recruit more drivers to the rural and suburban areas. Pyber can also standardize the costs of the ride so the customers from the suburban and rural cities are more inclined to use the service.
With the higher fares, it's most likely less appealing to use Pyber in these areas. Lastly, Pyber can expand their services to more rural and suburban cities instead of just gathering in the same urban cities. 
Per the line graph below, urban cities by far generate majority of the revenue for Pyber.
